Bug-Report
Welcome to the Bug-Report!

You have been tasked with creating a tool to better report bugs for your team. The goal being, to better track bugs in your application, as well as the process taken to solve them.

All bugs will have a title, description, who reported the bug, closedDate and whether or not it has been closed.

Users can also add notes to the bug report providing detailed steps towards the bugs resolution.

Once a bug has been closed, no further editing is allowed.

Here are some mock-ups from the client

Home View:

From the Home page users can view all the bugs that have been added, color coded to which are open and closed.

Challenges
Try to implement pagination here, as well as being able to sort by the status or the reported date. 


Details View:

The details view provides some additional information about the bug, as well as showing all the comments made by other users. Here comments can be created, flagged for review or removed.

Challenges:
See if you can implement the ability to go next or previous from this page.
